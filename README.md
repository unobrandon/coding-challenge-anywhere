### Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my experience and approach to iOS mobile development.

#### For this coding exercise I have implemented the VIPER architecture, which works best for large-scale applications. This architecture separates the application into five distinct layers (view, interactor, presenter, entity, & router), with each layer having its own responsibility. This approach promotes scalability, testability, and maintainability of the application.

#### To demonstrate robustness and lightweight design, I have used all native frameworks in my application. This approach ensures compatibility with future iOS updates and maximizes performance.

#### I have created multiple schemes to build multiple apps from one codebase. By leveraging this approach, this enables flexablilty to personalize each app. Simply select a scheme to change clients.

#### More Features:
* Search characters
* Download remote image
* Desplays placeholder if returned empty iconUrl
* Portrait and Landscape orientations
* iPhone and iPad support
* Multiple clients in one codebase
* Dark mode

### Thank you again for your time and consideration. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss my application further and look forward to hearing from you soon. - Brandon Shaw
